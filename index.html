          My name is Zhou Ci Lang Yuan, but I prefer to be called
          <strong>Brock</strong>.

          I was born in Shanghai, China, and came to Canada just before I
          graduate elementary school.

          I have completed my bachelor's degree in MACM from SFU and now I'm
          persuing the CIT diploma.

          I <em>love</em> Marvel movies! My favourite character is Doctor
          Strange as I think he is by far the coolest avenger.
