            My name is Zhou Ci Lang Yuan, but I prefer to be called
            <strong>Brock</strong>.

            I was born in Shanghai, China, and came to Canada just before I
            graduate elementary school.

            I have completed my bachelor's degree in MACM from SFU and now I'm
            persuing the CIT diploma.

            I <em>love</em> Marvel movies! My favourite character is Doctor
            Strange as I think he is by far the coolest avenger.
