    <h1>A paragraph about me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Zhou Ci Lang Yuan, but I prefer to be called
      <strong>Brock</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Shanghai, China, and came to Canada just before I graduate
      elementary school.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have completed my bachelor's degree in MACM from SFU and now I'm
      persuing the CIT diploma.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <em>love</em> Marvel movies! My favourite character is Doctor Strange as
      I think he is by far the coolest avenger.
